Nelisa runs a spaza shop in Khayelitsha. She heard that I am doing programming and would like some help with her stock information.

She introduces me to her staff, and told me about her customers.

To help build the system I have Personas,the main people who are involved with Nelisaâ€™s Cash Store.
I took into consideration all the things that are important to them, when I create a solution for them.

Nelisa: Owner of Nelisa's Cash Store
Xolani: Works at Nelisa's Cash Store
Nthabiseng: Customer of Nelisa's Cash Store

Nelisa and Xolani want a solution that helps to improve their purchasing, so that they can purchase products in bulk (and reduce their prices) and have the right products in stock to keep the customer happy.

Now we need to create a Story Map to clarify what we as coders need to do, so that we can see what to create as a solution.
